torch_itl
=========

Algorithms for solving Infinite Task Learning problems. Currently, we handle the following problems:

- Joint Quantile Regression
- Emotion Transfer with squared loss
- ITL with general loss provided from the user based on pytorch autodiff

Demos
=========

You can find examples for both problems in the demo section, for both [quantile regression](https://github.com/allambert/torch_itl/tree/release/demos/quantile) and [emotion transfer](https://github.com/allambert/torch_itl/tree/release/demos/emotion_transfer)
