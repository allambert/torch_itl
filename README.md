torch_itl
=========

Algorithms for solving Infinite Task Learning problems. Currently, we handle the following problems:

- Joint Quantile Regression
- Emotion Transfer with squared loss
- ITL with general loss provided from the user based on pytorch autodiff

Demos
=========

You can find examples for both problems in the demo section, for both `quantile regression LINK` and `emotion transfer LINK`.
